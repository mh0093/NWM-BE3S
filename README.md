# NWM-BE3S

The compressed code of NWM-BE3S should be downloaded on your local station (mac/linux) and unzipped using the command: 

unzip NWM-BE3S.zip

The files contains the entire source code for the NWM-BE3S simulations and users will need to generate forcing and domain inputs according to their purpose.

The model code has been tested using modules such as intel/2018b, netCDF/4.6.1, netCDF-Fortran/4.4.4.
